# Anvyl Specs

> Create the foundation of physical intelligence for industry.

This repository contains the core specifications for Anvyl’s egocentric industrial data:

- **Recording protocol** — how we capture first-person industrial work (camera setup, safety, angles, durations).
- **Dataset structure** — recommended folder layout for raw and processed video.
- **Metadata schema** — JSON fields describing tasks, tools, environment, and actors.
- **Labeling guidelines** — how we annotate actions, tools, and workflows.
- **Sample configs & examples** — small examples to illustrate how everything fits together.

These specs are a living document. As we learn from real workshops and factories, we’ll update them to better reflect the realities of skilled industrial work.
